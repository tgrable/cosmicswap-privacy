  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="effective-date">Effective date: February 21, 2026</p>

  <p>
    This privacy policy applies to <strong>Cosmic Swap</strong> (also known as CosmicSwap),
    a match-three puzzle game for iOS.
  </p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>

  <p>Cosmic Swap collects two types of data:</p>

  <h2>1. Crash Data</h2>
  <p>
    When the app crashes, we collect a crash report that may include: the type of crash,
    device model, iOS version, app version, and in-game event breadcrumbs (a log of recent
    actions leading up to the crash). This data is sent to
    <a href="https://sentry.io">Sentry</a> (sentry.io) and is used solely to identify and
    fix bugs.
  </p>
  <p>Crash data is <strong>not linked to your identity</strong> and is not used for advertising or tracking.</p>

  <h2>2. Per-Install Device Identifier</h2>
  <p>
    Cosmic Swap generates a random identifier when you install the app. This identifier is
    stored locally on your device and resets if you reinstall the app. It is used to count
    how many distinct devices are affected by a given crash, which helps us prioritize fixes.
  </p>
  <p>
    This identifier is <strong>not an advertising identifier</strong> (it is not your IDFA).
    It is <strong>not linked to your identity</strong> and is not used for tracking or advertising.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name, email address, or any contact information</li>
    <li>Your location</li>
    <li>Advertising identifiers (IDFA)</li>
    <li>Third-party analytics</li>
    <li>Account data of any kind</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tracking and Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Cosmic Swap does not track you across apps or websites. Your data is never used for
    advertising purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Crash data is processed by <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/">Sentry</a>, which has
    its own privacy policy. No other third-party data processors are used.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Crash reports are retained by Sentry for 90 days. The per-install identifier exists
    only on your device and is removed when you uninstall the app.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <p>
    You may opt out of crash reporting by uninstalling the app. There are no in-app
    settings to disable crash collection at this time.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    If we make material changes to this policy, we will update the effective date above.
    Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance.
